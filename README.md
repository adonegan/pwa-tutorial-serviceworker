# Progressive Web App Tutorial on creating service worker

This repository is from a tutorial on Udemy's Learn to Build Progressive Web apps using JavaScript course. In this project I added an index.html page with boilerplate and script for registering and loading the service worker in the browser.

Following this, I added the service-worker.js file and added three event listener specifications - intall, active and fetch. To test this, I add the style.css page to see if it would be fetched by the service worker.
